# AutomateRoop
In this project, I will attempt to automate ROOP. I have set up a Jenkins job that will facilitate the swapping of faces.

The objectives of this project include:

a. Downloading a video from a given link (currently configured for downloading Instagram reels).
b. Saving the downloaded reel to a specified directory, alongside other existing videos, to prepare for the subsequent face swap.
c. Executing the face swap process using ROOP.

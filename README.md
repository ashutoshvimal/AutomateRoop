# AutomateRoop
In this project, I will attempt to automate ROOP. I have set up a Jenkins job that will facilitate the swapping of faces.

The objectives of this project include:

### Features

- **Downloading a video:**
  - Download a video from a given link (currently configured for downloading Instagram reels).

- **Saving the downloaded reel:**
  - Save the downloaded reel to a specified directory, alongside other existing videos, to prepare for the subsequent face swap.

- **Executing the face swap process:**
  - Execute the face swap process using ROOP.
